// Package k8cache provides caching utilities for Kubernetes API responses.
// It includes middleware for intercepting cluster API requests, generating
// unique cache keys, storing and retrieving responses, and invalidating
// entries when resources change. The package aims to reduce redundant
// API calls, improve performance, and handle authorization gracefully
// while maintaining consistency across multiple Kubernetes contexts.
